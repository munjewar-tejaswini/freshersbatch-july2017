  <h2>Jaguar</h2>
  <p>The jaguar (Panthera onca) is a big cat, a feline in the Panthera genus, and is the only extant Panthera
  species native to the Americas. The jaguar is the third-largest feline species after the tiger and the lion,
  and the largest in the Americas.</p><p> The jaguar's present range extends from Southwestern United States and Mexico 
  across much of Central America and south to Paraguay and northern Argentina. Though there are single cats now living
  within the western United States, the species has largely been extirpated from the United States since the early 20th century.</p>

<p>This spotted cat most closely resembles the leopard physically, although it is usually larger and of sturdier build and its 
behavioral and habitat characteristics are closer to those of the tiger. While dense rainforest is its preferred habitat,
the jaguar will range across a variety of forested and open terrains.</p>
