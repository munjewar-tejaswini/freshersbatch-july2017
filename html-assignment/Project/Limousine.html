  <h2>Limousine</h2>
  <p>A limousine (or limo) is a luxury sedan or saloon car generally driven by a chauffeur and with a partition
  between the driver and the passenger compartment.</p> <p>Limousines often have a lengthened wheelbase. 
  Although usually associated with luxury vehicles, the word "Limousine" is also simply a generic term in some 
  countries for a standard sedan bodystyle.</p>
<p>It was originally an enclosed automobile with open driver's seat.[1] It is named after a type of cloak 
and hood that was worn by the inhabitants of the Limousin region that later resembled the covering of a 
carriage and much later used to describe an automobile body with a permanent top that extended over the open driver's compartment</p>
